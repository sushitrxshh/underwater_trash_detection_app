# Essential build tools (always place at the top)
pip>=23.0.1
setuptools>=65.5.0
wheel>=0.38.0

# Core Flask Application Dependencies
Flask==3.0.2
flask-cors==5.0.1
gunicorn==23.0.0

# AI/Computer Vision Dependencies
# Prefer opencv-python-headless for server environments (no GUI components)
opencv-python-headless==4.12.0.88
numpy==1.26.4 # Keeping this specific numpy version as it's often more stable with older ultralytics/tf
pillow==10.3.0
ultralytics==8.3.167

# Ultralytics often pulls its own torch/torchvision.
# Explicitly listing them can cause conflicts or large downloads.
# If ultralytics fails to install without them, you might need to add them back,
# but try without first.

# Other direct dependencies that might be pulled by the above, but good to list if needed
# requests==2.32.3 # Flask and other libs might pull this
# MarkupSafe==2.1.5 # Flask dependency
# Jinja2==3.1.3 # Flask dependency
# Werkzeug==3.0.2 # Flask dependency
# click==8.1.7 # Flask dependency

# For now, let's rely on Flask, ultralytics, and opencv-python-headless to pull their own sub-dependencies.
# This keeps the list minimal and reduces potential conflicts.
